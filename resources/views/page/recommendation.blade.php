    <h2>Dear Sir or Madam,</h2>
    <p>Mr. Douglas Miguel Oliveira Silveira, having worked in our company in the period between January 2012 and April 2014, in the role of Coordinator of Technology (Senior Web Application Developer), achieved during this time all activities efficiently, demonstrating his technical expertise and knowledge, as well as ease in learning and passing on his knowledge to others.</p>
    <p>He exceptionally managed during this period a technical team of twenty professionals, and was responsible for assisting developers in technical decisions, analysis and specification of designs, modeling and database publishing projects in customer servers.</p>
    <p>He also served as Senior back-end Developer on PHP / MySQL projects and front-end developer on HTML, CSS and JavaScript / jQuery projects.</p>
    <p>Mr. Douglas was dismissed due to a financial restructuring that occurred to our staff, which had to be reduced, and his dismissal consisted of nothing due to his passage through our firm, that could discredit him.</p>
    <p>I come through this to reaffirm our understanding that his qualities are: technical knowledge in developing web projects, competence, commitment, responsibility and maturity, from what we understand to be our duty to recommend him as a great new hiring to your company, in which he certainly would have much to add.</p>
    <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
