    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>I was born in Uberaba, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. I grew up on a farm, surrounded by lots of nature, and there I lived until the age of seven. I come from a simple family and I’ve always had ease with logic and numbers. When I was fourteen, already living in Uberaba, I found that internet pages were formed by “a bunch of codes and instructions” and said to myself: "I want to learn how to do that!" and since then I’ve fallen in love with coding and never stopped to learn about internet and web development.</p>
    <p>At sixteen I had my own startup (2003), a sale website of bovine semen for artificial insemination (<a href="http://portaldosemen.com.br/" target="_blank">http://portaldosemen.com.br/</a>). I worked on this project for two years and it was a great experience. Then, when I was twenty I decided to leave my hometown (2007) and venture in São Paulo (the biggest city in Brazil), in search of a new career and learning opportunities. I went to work in a very traditional company, the Casper Libero Foundation (<a href="http://fcl.com.br/" target="_blank">http://fcl.com.br/</a>).</p>
    <p>Between 2007 and 2015 I lived for a year in another Brazilian city, Joinville, SC (2010 at 2011) - always looking for professional growth and challenges. In 2011, I returned to São Paulo and met my wife, with whom I live today.</p>
    <p>I was fortunate to work for major national and international brands, on different areas, allowing optimal learning. In my opinion this is the coolest thing about working with web development, I am always doing something new, always being allowed to do something better than before.</p>
    <p>I love to watch series, read, vinyl records and music in general, take walks with my wife, go to cafes, museums, etc. Whenever I'm interested in a new technology I spend hours having fun in development.</p>
    <p>Today I am 29 years old and I feel very fulfilled professionally, but at the same time I know I have many things to learn, and feel a strong desire to always learn and become better every day. My next goal is to live abroad and in I have been preparing and pursuing this opportunity.</p>
    <h2>DEMONSTRATION PROJECT</h2>
    <p>I've been working on a Laravel 5.1 project in the past few months to manage a role-playing game (based on <strong>Vampire: The Masquerade</strong>) that I participate with my friends. This project is in <a href="https://gitlab.com/douglasmiguel/MIDCharacterSheet" target="_blank">GitLab</a>. All programming is in English, as well as the application.</p>
    <p>This project is a Linux server (Ubuntu) with PHP 5.6, MySQL and nginx. I was the one who set up this server on <a href="http://linode.com/" target="_blank">Linode</a>.</p>
    <p>The structure of the database is in _docs/Model directory (MySQL Workbench files).</p>
    <p>You can access the application using:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://midsheet.work/" target="_blank">http://midsheet.work/</a></li>
        <li><strong>E-mail:</strong> test@midsheet.work</li>
        <li><strong>Password:</strong> test</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are some blank pages, but navigating through the project one can find various things implemented (try create a character and print the PDF sheet).</p>
